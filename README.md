# To-Do List Application

This is a simple Java application for managing daily tasks. It allows you to add, view, and mark tasks as completed via a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Motivation

As a new developer, building this to-do list app was not just about practicing Java. It was about creating something tangible that could help me and others organize their day more effectively.

## Why This Project?

This to-do list app is more than just a project; it's a reflection of my learning process. It solves the simple problem of forgetting tasks and helps users keep track of their day-to-day activities.

## What I Learned

This project taught me the basics of Java, how to structure a project, work with version control, and write a README file. It's been a stepping stone in understanding how to build a user-friendly application from the ground up.
